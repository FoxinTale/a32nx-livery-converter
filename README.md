# a32nx-livery-converter
 A standalone livery converter for the post fork A32NX in MSFS 2020, made in Java. 
 Why Java? It's the only langauge I'm competent enough in to make such a thing.

This should be able to automatically detect symlinks and create/convert the appropriate livery in where you have your symlinks instead of the community folder.
